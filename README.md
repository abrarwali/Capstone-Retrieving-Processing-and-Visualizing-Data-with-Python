Coursera's course: Capstone: Retrieving, Processing, and Visualizing Data with Python, 
by University of Michigan


Capstone: Retrieving, Processing, and Visualizing Data with Python is the 5th Specialization in Coursera's course "Python for Everybody" taught by Prof. Charles Severance.

In the capstone, students have to build a series of applications to retrieve, process and visualize data using Python. The projects will involve all the elements of the specialization. In the first part of the capstone, students have to do some visualizations to become familiar with the technologies in use and then pursue their own project to visualize some other data that they have or can find. Chapters 15 and 16 from the book “Python for Everybody” will serve as the backbone for the capstone. This course covers Python 3
